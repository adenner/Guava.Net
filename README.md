Guava.Net
=========

A port of Google's [Guava Libraries](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) from Java to C#.

The goal of this project is to learn by working through a mature set of common libraries.  I'm not aiming to produce something production ready and some of the features provided by Guava may already exist in .Net libraries.
