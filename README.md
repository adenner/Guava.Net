Guava.Net
=========

A port of Google's [Guava Libraries](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) to C#


This project is mostly an excuse to work through a mature set of libraries rather than produce something production ready.  The features provided by Guava may already exist in .Net libraries so watch out for "Reinventing the Wheel" if you decide to use anything.
