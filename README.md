Guava.Net
=========

A port of Google's [Guava Libraries](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) to C#


This project is mostly an excuse to work through a mature set of libraries rather than produce something production ready.  The features provided by Guava may already exist in .Net libraries so watch out for some "Reinventing the Wheel".
